# PERX

**PERX** is a modern employee benefits marketplace built for Albania and designed to scale across Europe.

The platform connects **employees**, **employers**, and **service providers** in one benefits ecosystem. Companies fund employee benefit credit, employees choose the benefits they actually want, and local providers receive verified redemptions through QR tickets and benefit codes.

PERX was built for the **JunctionX Tirana / TeamSystem challenge**.

## Live Demo

The PERX demo is available here:

**Demo:** https://project-7xnzk.vercel.app

Use the demo accounts below to test the employee, employer, and service provider flows.

---

## Core Idea

PERX turns employee benefits into a marketplace.

Instead of giving employees generic perks or only salary increases, a company gives them benefit credit. Employees can then use that balance to select offers from local providers such as gyms, restaurants, learning centers, clinics, telecom providers, travel agencies, wellness studios, and retail partners.

The current MVP focuses on Albania with:

- Albanian-first interface
- Albanian Lek pricing
- Albanian provider examples
- Albania map coverage
- Employer budget management
- QR-based redemption
- AI-powered benefit recommendations
- Employee gifting
- Tax-saving comparisons

---

## Problem

Employee benefits are often underused because they are not personal, not easy to redeem, and not clearly connected to real employee needs.

Companies also have limited tools to understand what their team actually wants. Service providers, on the other hand, do not have a simple way to access company-funded demand.

PERX solves this by making benefits:

- easier to discover
- easier to redeem
- easier to manage
- easier to measure
- more personal for employees
- more useful for employers
- more accessible for local service providers

---

## Solution

PERX provides one platform for the full benefit lifecycle:

1. The employer funds benefit credit for employees.
2. Employees browse or ask the AI concierge for recommendations.
3. Employees select benefits, packages, or gifts.
4. Employers can approve requests and track spending.
5. Providers validate QR tickets or manual codes.
6. PERX shows usage, spending, and category insights.

## Run Locally

This project runs with Node.js and npm.

Tested locally with:

```txt
Node.js: v22.16.0
npm: 10.9.2
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app normally starts on:

```txt
http://localhost:8080
```

If port `8080` is already used, Vite will automatically use another port. Use the URL printed in the terminal.

To force a specific port:

```bash
npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8099
```

To expose it on the local network:

```bash
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

---

## Build Locally

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

To preview on a specific port:

```bash
npm run preview -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8100
```

---

## Environment Variables

The repository includes a `.env` file for the demo. It is required for Supabase, maps, and connected demo data.

Current required variables:

```env
SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=
SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
SUPABASE_URL=
VITE_LOVABLE_CONNECTOR_GOOGLE_MAPS_BROWSER_KEY=
VITE_LOVABLE_CONNECTOR_GOOGLE_MAPS_TRACKING_ID=
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=
```

For the submitted demo build, keep the provided `.env` file in place.

Supabase Edge Functions may also require server-side secrets when deployed through Supabase:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

These are used by the Supabase functions under:

```txt
supabase/functions/concierge
supabase/functions/voucher-sign
supabase/functions/voucher-verify
```
